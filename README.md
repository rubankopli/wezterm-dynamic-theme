## About
I couldn't find any wezterm configs that had a cool dynamic theme like I was looking for, so I decided to make my own! 
I borrowed heavily from the wezterm official documentation's [Parallax Example](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/config/lua/config/background.html#parallax-example) and edited an existing wallpaper image I found to break it into a few layers, which I could use with the wezterm configuration to bring my idea to life. The project uses a few different image layers with varying opacity and 'scroll speed' to give the impression of semi see-through window panes and rain.
